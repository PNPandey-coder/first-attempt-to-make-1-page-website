# first-attempt-to-make-1-page-website
In this project I have tried to put whatever  I have learned as new fresh CSS and want to give it wings by making 1 page website, showing products of a specific company without using flexbox and grid 

I will now stop this project because this design is not good and start new one that also without flexbox
